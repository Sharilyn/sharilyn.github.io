# The Thing About Sharilyn

### Too Big To Fail

Forty-plus years on this earth have taught me that I am good at some things. And I have a few things going for me, including:

* Quick at picking up languages
* Charming as hell
* Appetite for working really hard
* Sunny outlook
* Smart as a whip
* Talented artist
* Really nice hair

I also have some challenges, but I try not to dwell on those:

- Way too tall
- Misanthropic
- Hate housework
- Cranky when tired
