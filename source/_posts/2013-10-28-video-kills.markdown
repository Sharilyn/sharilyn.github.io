###Video Killed the Radio Star

I had lunch with Michael today, and when we weren't psychoanalysing Seth and Peter, we talked about how difficult it is to ingest a lot of instructional videos. Is it an age thing? I had to drop out of the Code Coalition class because watching video after five-miute video was almost physically painful for me. I ditched out of Code School for the same reason. I think the lack of video is one of the reasons codecademy works so well for me. I'd rather follow along with written directions. For some reason that is happier for my brain.

I had to quit that newspaper job. The money was absolutely terrible, so terrible that it didn't even make financial sense to continue. And having one insane job is enough for now. 

Twenty-six days of sobriety and I'm feeling pretty awesome. The hormone swings are still happening, but not as bad. I didn't get to work out too much this last week but I'm still feeling stronger than before. There's something about my body that feels more organized and less foreign now. I haven't lost a size yet but I haven't let that keep me from shopping.

Finished first real homework on time. Though I got my ruby to pass the tests, I'm not really sure what or why. I'm learning about my own process that I'm kind of an instinctive learner, especially with regard to learning language.
